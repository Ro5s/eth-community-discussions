The Ethereum Virtial Machine was originally developed in order for smart contracts to be run
on the Ethereum blockchain, and both that protocol and the EVM has been implemented in many languages. 

As a large development, testing, and security ecosystem emerged around the EVM, other blockchains
and scalability solutions began to adopt the EVM, enabling developers of smart contracts to run 
their applications outside of Ethereum mainnet.
