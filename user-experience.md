[Micropayments and Mental Transaction Costs](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/static/docs/micropayments-and-mental-transaction-costs.pdf) by Nick Szabo

We present intuitive arguments for why micropayments have not succeeded
on the Internet. The "hassle factor" for customers associated with such transactions
is characterized. A framework of mental transaction costs and price
granularity is then presented, and arguments about micropayments recast in its
light. Finally, we make some suggestions for reducing the mental transaction
costs of Internet commerce.
